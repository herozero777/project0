## Short Writeup For my project0
I have build a personal webpage describing myself and some of my work. I have added little content in the website as my main focus was completing the project. I tried my best to make it meaningful in terms of the content I added.
I have a 4 html files, 1 scss & 1 css file.
There is an images folder which contains an image used in the project.

## Conents of Each of the file in my project

### index.html
This is the main page of the project. It has links to 3 other pages in the document. It has a bio section describing about myself. I created a CSS Selectors table here because it made rememebering this easy and fun.

### resume.html
This page only contains an image of my favorite game "League Of Legends" and that's pretty much it.

### projects.html
This file Contains description about some of the projects that I worked on during my bachelors. I used bootstrap's component card to display the information.

### CV.html
This is and empty page, it just contains links to the other pages.
