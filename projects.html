                <p class="card-text">In this project we applied machine learning concepts to Object Recognition
                  problem using multiple models of increasing complexity. We started out with Softmax Regression
                  tutorial on TensorFlow website. After this I had to make a MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and
                  train it using Dogs & Cats dataset. Finally I trained the same MLP to Stanford Cars dataset.</p>

                <p class="card-text">For this project we had to implement a link-state routing protocol from scratch in Python. The project manual
only told about a naïve approach of advertising packets and we had to optimize it. We had to use threading and
also account for cases where routers would fail.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The work in start was very theoretical and we had to stomach lots of knowledge and a few papers. I read first
few chapters of the book Fundamentals of speech recognition. My first task was to transcribe a 30 minutes Urdu
audio clip. Next I had to set up KALDI frame for learning this data. I first practiced KALDI with the Voxforge
dataset. After that I was only able to train the system for digits recognition as my semester started after that.</p>
